## Installation

As this is a back end based project, if this repo is downloaded, the user will need to ensure they have Node.js and MongoDB installed. The user will then be able to run "npm i" to install the necessary dependencies for the project. The user can then run "npm run dev" to start the application. The application can then be used within the MongoDB application or within Insomnia to run the various routes.

## Usage

When the user runs the applicable routes for view all users, view all thoughts, create user, create reaction, add friend, etc., the user will be able to see the results within the Insomnia application. Some example videos are below, where you can view the GIFs or go directly to the associated Google Drive link.
